Overview
--------
 acgtools is a driver for ACG HF MultiISO RFID reader. This device consists of
 an OEM RFID reader circuit connected to an FTDI USB serial converter. The
 communications protocol is ASCII or, optionally, binary. Although projects
 like RFIDIOt support this device, I wanted to play with some of the extended
 features such as:
  o Identifying protocol used for tag communications
  o Retreiving ATS and REQA for RFID tags
  o Continuous select and multi-select
  o Page read mode where data blocks are automatically read from any tag
    entering the field and stored for later retrieval.
  o The binary protocol, although I have been too scared to enable this one for
    fear of even temporarily bricking the device ;) To this end EEPROM
    dump/flash tools are included as well as a nice interactive command-line
    tool for editing the EEPROM images in a meaningful way.

Implemented features
--------------------
 o Driver module supporting the following features:
   o Uses hal/dbus to automatically detect and configure USB serial port
   o Select, high speed select, multi-select, continuous-select
   o Select returns protcol, REQA answer, ATS, cascade-level where supported
   o EEPROM read/write
   o Mifare login/readblock
   o Custom APDU transmission
 o EEPROM flash/dump/edit toolset
 o select/multi-select/continuous-select/continuous-multiselect tool
 o mifare-transport-keys example tools
 o Machine-readable-travel-document tool which sets up secure communications
   with an ePassport and dumps the contents of the passport to disk.

Configuration
-------------
 If your system supports hal/dbus then devices should be automatically detected.
 If not, then you will need to edit the configuration file in ~/.acgtools, the
 format consists of space separated lines, one for each device in the following
 format:

 <tty> [baud]

 For example:

 /dev/ttyUSB0 460800
 /dev/ttyUSB1

 If baud rate is ommitted then it will default to 460800.
